Their record in those contests is 4-2.</li><li>Tonight marked the Warriors’ 570<sup>th</sup> consecutive sellout, the second-longest active streak in the NBA and the sixth-longest all-time. </li><li><strong>Jimmy Butler III</strong> recorded a game-high 21 points, team-high nine rebounds, team-high seven assists, two steals and one block… It was Butler III’s seventh 20-point game of the current campaign, and second this season against the Pacers (20 on 11/1/25 at IND).</li><li><strong>Will Richard</strong> tallied 15 points off the bench, his third consecutive game scoring in double figures (averaging 19.0 ppg in that span)… His seven made free throws are the most for a Warriors rookie since <strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> made seven on 3/28/22 at MEM.</li><li><strong>Al Horford</strong> grabbed four rebounds, moving him with into a tie for 58<sup>th</sup>place on the NBA all-time rebounds list (<strong>Larry Bird</strong>, 8,974 career rebounds)… Horford made all four of his 3-point attempts to finish with 12 points, his second game scoring 10-or-more points this season. </li><li><strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> grabbed eight rebounds, extending his career-best rebounding streak of five-or-more to 10 consecutive games.</li><li><strong>Quinten Post </strong>recorded a season-high tying 14 points (third time) and season-high tying eight rebounds (10/28 vs. LAC) in his sixth start of the season.  </li><li><strong>Stephen Curry</strong> missed his third consecutive game with an illness (the Warriors are 1-2 in games he has missed this season)… Since 2014-15, the Warriors are 75-113 (.399) without Curry in the lineup.</li></ul>",
