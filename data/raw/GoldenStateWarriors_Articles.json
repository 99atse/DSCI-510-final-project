The last time the Warriors began a season winning five-straight home contests was the 2018-19 season when they opened the season with six consecutive home victories.</li><li>Tonight’s win snapped a four-game losing streak to Indiana (home and road) and a six-game losing streak to the Pacers at Chase Center… Entering tonight’s contest, the Pacers had never lost at Chase Center (6-0).</li><li>The two teams split the 2025-26 season series, 1-1… According to the Elias Sports Bureau, this is the fifth-fewest games into a campaign that the Warriors have completed a season series vs. an opponent (the record is six games, during the 2005-06 season, against the Knicks)… For the Pacers, this is the second fewest games (10) for them to finish playing an opponent in a single season (nine, twice). </li><li>The Warriors held the Pacers to 83 points, the second fewest they have allowed to an opponent this season (79, 10/28/25 vs. LAC)… The 83 points scored matched the fewest points Warriors have allowed to the Pacers in a contest all-time (3/5/99).</li><li>Golden State’s 31-point margin of victory was the highest this season (prev. 19, 98-79 on 10/28/25 vs. LAC) and the largest since a 38-point win on 4/8/25 at PHX (133-95)… The last time the Warriors won a home game by that margin was on 2/25/25 vs. CHA (128-92)… The 31-point win also marked the team’s largest win in a game without <strong>Stephen Curry</strong> since he entered the league in 2009-10 (ESPN). </li><li>The Warriors turned the ball over 10 times, the second-fewest in a game this season (nine on 10/23/25 vs. DEN)… Golden State improved to 4-0 when recording fewer turnovers than the team’s opponent this season (IND – 22). </li><li>For the second time this season the Warriors had six players score in double figures (other instance was on 10/23/25 vs. DEN).</li><li>For the sixth time this season the Warriors recorded at least 10 steals (11 tonight). Their record in those contests is 4-2.</li><li>Tonight marked the Warriors’ 570<sup>th</sup> consecutive sellout, the second-longest active streak in the NBA and the sixth-longest all-time. </li><li><strong>Jimmy Butler III</strong> recorded a game-high 21 points, team-high nine rebounds, team-high seven assists, two steals and one block… It was Butler III’s seventh 20-point game of the current campaign, and second this season against the Pacers (20 on 11/1/25 at IND).</li><li><strong>Will Richard</strong> tallied 15 points off the bench, his third consecutive game scoring in double figures (averaging 19.0 ppg in that span)… His seven made free throws are the most for a Warriors rookie since <strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> made seven on 3/28/22 at MEM.</li><li><strong>Al Horford</strong> grabbed four rebounds, moving him with into a tie for 58<sup>th</sup>place on the NBA all-time rebounds list (<strong>Larry Bird</strong>, 8,974 career rebounds)… Horford made all four of his 3-point attempts to finish with 12 points, his second game scoring 10-or-more points this season. </li><li><strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> grabbed eight rebounds, extending his career-best rebounding streak of five-or-more to 10 consecutive games.</li><li><strong>Quinten Post </strong>recorded a season-high tying 14 points (third time) and season-high tying eight rebounds (10/28 vs. LAC) in his sixth start of the season.  </li><li><strong>Stephen Curry</strong> missed his third consecutive game with an illness (the Warriors are 1-2 in games he has missed this season)… Since 2014-15, the Warriors are 75-113 (.399) without Curry in the lineup.</li></ul>",

Their record in those contests is 4-2.</li><li>Tonight marked the Warriors’ 570<sup>th</sup> consecutive sellout, the second-longest active streak in the NBA and the sixth-longest all-time. </li><li><strong>Jimmy Butler III</strong> recorded a game-high 21 points, team-high nine rebounds, team-high seven assists, two steals and one block… It was Butler III’s seventh 20-point game of the current campaign, and second this season against the Pacers (20 on 11/1/25 at IND).</li><li><strong>Will Richard</strong> tallied 15 points off the bench, his third consecutive game scoring in double figures (averaging 19.0 ppg in that span)… His seven made free throws are the most for a Warriors rookie since <strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> made seven on 3/28/22 at MEM.</li><li><strong>Al Horford</strong> grabbed four rebounds, moving him with into a tie for 58<sup>th</sup>place on the NBA all-time rebounds list (<strong>Larry Bird</strong>, 8,974 career rebounds)… Horford made all four of his 3-point attempts to finish with 12 points, his second game scoring 10-or-more points this season. </li><li><strong>Jonathan Kuminga</strong> grabbed eight rebounds, extending his career-best rebounding streak of five-or-more to 10 consecutive games.</li><li><strong>Quinten Post </strong>recorded a season-high tying 14 points (third time) and season-high tying eight rebounds (10/28 vs. LAC) in his sixth start of the season.  </li><li><strong>Stephen Curry</strong> missed his third consecutive game with an illness (the Warriors are 1-2 in games he has missed this season)… Since 2014-15, the Warriors are 75-113 (.399) without Curry in the lineup.</li></ul>",
